<h2>Project: H2OVue - Water Bill Management System</h2>

![Schematic Diagram](https://github.com/sachindumalshan/H2OVue/assets/73152414/26a9ba40-015f-46a9-b770-d7cbae95fb11)
H2OVue is the project of blending modern technology and the Internet of Things (IoT). This project is aimed at simplifying and improving the lives of homeowners by providing an automatic water bill management system. With H2OVue, users can effortlessly obtain their water bills without any manual input. Sensors measure water consumption and calculate the bill automatically.

‚öôÔ∏è Hardware Components:
- ESP32 Microcontroller Board
- Water Flow Sensor

üñ•Ô∏è Utilized Technologies:
- Arduino
- PHP
- MySQL
<br/>

üí° What Can H2OVue Do?
- The H2OVue project leverages the Arduino software and ESP32 board in conjunction with a MySQL database and PHP as the backend language. Utilizing a water flow sensor, the system calculates water unit usage and sends this data to the database. A reporting mechanism has been implemented using the TCPDF library and PHP, allowing users to generate and download reports through a straightforward web page.

üíß Water Flow Management:
- The core of H2OVue's functionality lies in the Water Flow Sensor. This sensor reads values related to water consumption.

üìä Data Transmission to Database:
- The H2OVue system, constructed using Arduino software and an ESP32 board, ensures seamless connectivity with a MySQL database. The water flow sensor's readings are transmitted to the database, facilitating real-time tracking and storage of water usage data.

üìà Reporting System:
- To enhance user insights, the system utilizes the TCPDF library in conjunction with PHP. This combination allows the generation of detailed reports based on the data collected from the water flow sensor.

üì• Report Download:
- Users can conveniently access and download these reports through a straightforward web page. The generated reports provide a comprehensive overview of water usage trends, enabling informed decision-making for efficient water resource management.

This project exemplifies the synergy between robotics, database connectivity, and web development, showcasing their seamless integration.<br/>

Let's elevate our homes to be more intelligent, and resource-efficient with H2OVue! üè†


<h4><u>Step 1:</u></h4>
I constructed a charming wooden house prototype using carefully cut and assembled wooden boards. For my circuit board, I placed the components on the board, soldered them together, and tested it for functionality.

<h4><u>Step 2:</u></h4>
Creating a seamless connection between an ESP32 board and the Arduino Cloud Platform is an exciting venture. By configuring variables within the Arduino Cloud, you can monitor and control your ESP32 remotely. Upload the code to your board using the Arduino Create Agent software for real-time data exchange. This combination of IoT technology promises not only functionality but an elegant solution for remotely managing your devices.
