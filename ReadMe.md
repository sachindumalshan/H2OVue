<h2>Project: NexHaven - IoT Based Home Automation System</h2>

![NexHaven](https://github.com/sachindumalshan/NexHaven/assets/73152414/762239ca-b746-451d-969d-898f3cd1d57e)
NexHaven is the result of my passion for home automation, combining cutting-edge technology and the power of the Internet of Things (IoT). This project is designed to make life smarter, more convenient, and safer for homeowners.

🧩 Key Components:
- ESP32 Microcontroller Board
- PIR Sensor
- Magnetic Door Switch Sensor
- Flame Sensor
- MQ-5 LP Gas Sensor
- LED Lights
- DHT11 Sensor
- Water Level Sensor
- 2 x 3.7V 18650mAh Batteries

💡 What Can NexHaven Do?
NexHaven connects all these components to create a seamless home automation system. Users can remotely access and control their homes from anywhere in the world, thanks to the always-on internet connection. With the help of the Arduino Cloud Platform, you can monitor sensor data through a web dashboard or a dedicated app.

🏠 Home Security:
- The PIR sensor detects motion, enhancing your home's security.
- The magnetic door lock sensor provides alerts if doors or windows are opened without permission.
- The flame sensor keeps you safe by detecting fire hazards.
- The MQ-5 LP Gas Sensor alerts you to potential gas leaks.

🌡️ Climate Control:
- The DHT11 Sensor keeps you informed about the temperature and humidity levels in your home.

💧 Water Management:
- The Water Level Sensor helps you manage water resources efficiently.

💡 Lighting Control:
- You can control the LED lights in your home through the app.

This project demonstrates the power of IoT by allowing you to stay connected to your home no matter where you are.

Let's make our homes smarter, safer, and more efficient with NexHaven!✨


<h4><u>Step 1:</u></h4>
I constructed a charming wooden house prototype using carefully cut and assembled wooden boards. For my circuit board, I placed the components on the board, soldered them together, and tested it for functionality.

<h4><u>Step 2:</u></h4>
Creating a seamless connection between an ESP32 board and the Arduino Cloud Platform is an exciting venture. By configuring variables within the Arduino Cloud, you can monitor and control your ESP32 remotely. Upload the code to your board using the Arduino Create Agent software for real-time data exchange. This combination of IoT technology promises not only functionality but an elegant solution for remotely managing your devices.
