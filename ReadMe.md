<h2>Project: H2OVue - Water Bill Management System</h2>

![Schematic Diagram](https://github.com/sachindumalshan/H2OVue/assets/73152414/26a9ba40-015f-46a9-b770-d7cbae95fb11)
H2OVue is the project of blending modern technology and the Internet of Things (IoT). This project is aimed at simplifying and improving the lives of homeowners by providing an automatic water bill management system. With H2OVue, users can effortlessly obtain their water bills without any manual input. Sensors measure water consumption and calculate the bill automatically.

‚öôÔ∏è Hardware Components:
- ESP32 Microcontroller Board
- Water Flow Sensor

üñ•Ô∏è Utilized Technologies:
- Arduino
- PHP
- MySQL

üí° What Can H2OVue Do?
NexHaven connects all these components to create a seamless home automation system. Users can remotely access and control their homes from anywhere in the world, thanks to the always-on internet connection. With the help of the Arduino Cloud Platform, you can monitor sensor data through a web dashboard or a dedicated app.

üè† Home Security:
- The PIR sensor detects motion, enhancing your home's security.
- The magnetic door lock sensor provides alerts if doors or windows are opened without permission.
- The flame sensor keeps you safe by detecting fire hazards.
- The MQ-5 LP Gas Sensor alerts you to potential gas leaks.

üå°Ô∏è Climate Control:
- The DHT11 Sensor keeps you informed about the temperature and humidity levels in your home.

üíß Water Management:
- The Water Level Sensor helps you manage water resources efficiently.

üí° Lighting Control:
- You can control the LED lights in your home through the app.

This project demonstrates the power of IoT by allowing you to stay connected to your home no matter where you are.

<h4><u>Step 1:</u></h4>
I constructed a charming wooden house prototype using carefully cut and assembled wooden boards. For my circuit board, I placed the components on the board, soldered them together, and tested it for functionality.

<h4><u>Step 2:</u></h4>
Creating a seamless connection between an ESP32 board and the Arduino Cloud Platform is an exciting venture. By configuring variables within the Arduino Cloud, you can monitor and control your ESP32 remotely. Upload the code to your board using the Arduino Create Agent software for real-time data exchange. This combination of IoT technology promises not only functionality but an elegant solution for remotely managing your devices.
